# RecyclerView_with_MVVM
At this time (Aug 2020), there are several code examples of Recyclerview with MVVM architecture that are not compiled or not fit right into architecture, even example code on the official Android document. In this repo, I implement a simple Recyclerview with MVVM architecture.

Using:
- Kotlin
- MVVM architectural pattern
- lifecycle
- LiveData
- RecyclerView

TODO:
- Navigation
- Retrofit
- Paging
- Dark theme
